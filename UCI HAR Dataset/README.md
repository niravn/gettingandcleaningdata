The script works is a fairly simple format. 

Initially tables of training and testing are read into two variables and the bound into a third variable. This is repeated three times to create a combined data set that can be analyzed. 

The next step is to implement an extraction process - this is done using the "read.table" function and applied to the "feat" variable. 

Activities are labeled to ensure readablity, lastly cleanse function is performed to give you the clean tidy data set that has average values
